# Wine Quality Classification with Random Forest

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a **Random Forest Classifier** to classify wine quality based on its chemical properties. The tutorial covers the dataset's features, Random Forest's working principles, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

## Features
- **Robust and accurate predictions** using Random Forest.
- Hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
- Visualizations for feature importance and evaluation metrics.
- Easy-to-follow code implementation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 1,599 rows and 12 columns describing chemical properties of wines and their respective quality scores. Key attributes include:
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Alcohol  
**Target Variable**: `quality` (a score from 0 to 10).
